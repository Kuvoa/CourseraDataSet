# Coursera Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the Coursera course dataset to uncover patterns in course difficulty, enrollment numbers, ratings, and organizations. The goal is to gain insights using data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and effective visualizations with Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from [Coursera courses on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/siddharthm1698/coursera-course-dataset) and contains information such as:

- `course_title`
- `course_organization`
- `course_Certificate_type`
- `course_rating`
- `course_difficulty`
- `course_students_enrolled`

---

## Data Cleaning

Steps included:

- Handled missing values  
- Removed duplicates  
- Fixed encoding and formatting issues (e.g., organization name inconsistencies)  
- Converted data types where necessary  

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Analyses performed:

- Distribution of course difficulties  
- Course rating trends by difficulty  
- Enrollment and course trends by organization  
- Correlation between features like course difficulty and student count  

Visualizations used:

- Bar plots  
- Box plots  
- Scatter plots  
- Trend lines

## Tools Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Key Insights

- Beginner-level courses dominate the Coursera platform  
- Courses offered by top universities and tech companies show high enrollment and ratings  
- There's a positive correlation between the number of courses offered and student enrollment for some organizations

## Future Improvements

- Add time-series analysis if timestamps become available  
- Deploy insights via an interactive dashboard using Power BI
